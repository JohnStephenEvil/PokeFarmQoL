- Advanced Shelter Search with custom search parameters.
- Select all Pokémon on field mass release, mass move & fishing.
- Advanced Fields sorting & Pokémons clicked counter in fields

# Open Issues
- ~~**Multiuser Page** - Party Mods don't work~~
- ~~**Farm Page** - Sorting by new dex entry doesn't work~~
- ~~**Public Fields** - Searching other player's fields doesn't work~~

# Open Suggestions
- **Public/Private Field** - Move "sort by" toggles above search fields
- **Private Field** - Highlight pokemon that are ready to evolve (not by item)
- **Private Field** - Highlight pokemon that are ready to evolve (by item)

# Past Suggestions/Issues
- **Farm Page** - Easy Evolution doesn't work when the list is sorted - This was not fixed, because it is impossible to implement given the current design of the sorted lists without copying code from pokefarm.
- **Shelter** - Add nature/berry selector - This feature was not implemented, because it would 1) cause the shelter page to be extremely slow, 2) requires additional information not readily available on the shelter page, and 3) (may) break the one-click rule.
