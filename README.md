# PokeFarmQoL
Userscript that includes a few QoL changes to Pokéfarm and can enhance your Pokéfarm experience even more!

# Features
- Pokémon evolve list in the farm sorted on types.
- Advanced Shelter Search with custom search parameters.
- Select all Pokémon on field mass release, mass move & fishing.
- Advanced Fields sorting & Pokémons clicked counter in fields
- Mass party clicking modifications
- Highlight eligible breeding partners for a pokemon while searching from the daycare

# Past Suggestions/Issues
- **Farm Page** - Easy Evolution doesn't work when the list is sorted - This was not fixed, because it is impossible to implement given the current design of the sorted lists without copying code from pokefarm.
- **Shelter** - Add nature/berry selector - This feature was not implemented, because it would 1) cause the shelter page to be extremely slow, 2) requires additional information not readily available on the shelter page, and 3) (may) break the one-click rule.
- **Shelter** - Highlight pokemon that are ready to evolve (by item) - This feature was not implemented, because it would require loading information from a user's inventory
