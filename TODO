Short-term goals:
- Initial testing as a userscript
- Update dex-data.txt, after loading base formes

Medium-term goals:
- Talk to staff, post in forums
- Figure out a way to test pages like wishforge
  in alternate configurations (ex: in-progress badges)
  (similarly to the old tests directories?)

Long-term goals:
- Bug fixes
- Change dex handling to be more flexible?
  Could this be crowdsourced like the wiki?
  What's the likelihood it dies?
