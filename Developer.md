**Path to Sanctioned**
- [X] Remove '@resource' dependencies
    - Moved all data from '@resource' dependencies into resources.js file
    - Load data from resources.js when needed
- [X] Downgrade to jQuery 1.11.2
    - Changed installed version of jQuery in npm
    - Modified code to use Promises instead of $.Deferred objects, since they didn't exist
- [X] Remove '@require' dependencies
    - Create compile_build.sh script to compile into single Poke-Farm-QoL.user.js file
    - Move top level code to pfqol.js
- [ ] Setup framework for managing multiple scripts
    - Add ability to run tests on different UUT files
      - Added .env handling and a UUT env so I can specify which file to run on
    - Create build scripts for each version
      - test
      - user
      - sanctioned
    - Workflow from now on
      - Decide if code will be sanctioned-only, user-only, or both
        - If the code will be:
          - in sanctioned and in user         | common/foo.js
          - in sanctioned and not in user     | sanctioned/foo.js
          - not in sanctioned and in user     | user/foo.js
          - not in sanctioned and not in user | no need to write code :P
      - Add code in the appropriate file(s)
      - Add tests for new code
        - **How will tests be organized?**
      - Run existing and new tests
- [ ] Make it easy to build sanctioned and "extended" versions of script
    - Take the more problematic features out of sanctioned version
      - Loading pokedex data from the QoL hub
      - Using pokedex data in shelter and lab
        - Highlighting ready to evolve mons in shelter
        - Distinguishing regional forms
      - Hard code the regional forms list in the farm page
