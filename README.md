- **Pokedex** - Search for dual type pokemon
- **Public/Private Field** - Emulate advanced search features from shelter
- **Public/Private Field** - Make the automatic tooltip function toggable

# Past Suggestions/Issues
- **Farm Page** - Easy Evolution doesn't work when the list is sorted - This was not fixed, because it is impossible to implement given the current design of the sorted lists without copying code from pokefarm.
- **Shelter** - Add nature/berry selector - This feature was not implemented, because it would 1) cause the shelter page to be extremely slow, 2) requires additional information not readily available on the shelter page, and 3) (may) break the one-click rule.
- **Shelter** - Highlight pokemon that are ready to evolve (by item) - This feature was not implemented, because it would require loading information from a user's inventory
